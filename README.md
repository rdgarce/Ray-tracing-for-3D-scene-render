# Ray tracing for 3D scene render
A short and easy-to-use implementation of the ray tracing algorithm in python in the context of a 3D scene render.

## Why
*Ray tracing* as always been a buzz word for us and so we decided to investigate on computer graphics and scene illumination topics and implement an educational and easy-to-use version of the algorithm to creare a 3D scene renderer.
This code is the product of our work.

## What is it
In a nutshell, it allows the user to do the followings:
1. Generate a 3D scene composed of objects and a light
2. Set a point of view of this scene, known as a *camera*
3. Render the scene, and so producing the image that an observer would have seen if looking at the scene from the point of view

## Features:
- Easy scene and object creation
- All screen resolutions
- Movable camera
- Multiprocessor support for the scene rendering

## Limitations:
- (Obviusly) Not feasable for real time applications
- Only one light source supported
- Only spheres are available as scene objects
- Only light reflection rays are taken into account
- Camera angles are fixed
